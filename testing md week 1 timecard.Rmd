### Timecard  
**Monday** Aprx. 0 hours, 20 minutes - Brief brainstorm with partner of how to blog classwork  
**Tuesday** Aprx. 2 hours, 10 minutes - With partner, demoed installation of R; RStudio; RMarkdown on VM.  Discussed and learned about GitHub webpages and markdown as a way to maintain a blog that can show my work in R.  Compilation of resources.  
**Wednesday** Aprx. 3 hour, 14 minutes - Downloaded R; RStudio; RMarkdown on my own device.  Made GitHub account.  Looked through resources for markdown and used it to make this document.  Read through some of the introduction of required textbook *Learn R for Applied Statistics*.  Added Statistics-ILC Reprository to GitHub Desktop and discussed with partner how using reprositories would work; REPORT-Statistics-ILC and SOURCE-Statistics-ILC?  Manually putting .md into REPORT or using a script to move files?  Made submodule, made initial mid-week timestamp commit.
**Thursday (Official Week 1 Start)**  
**Friday**


###  Working Plan  
I am signed up for 6 credits with this ILC; the appropriate number of hours per week spent working for 6 undergraduate credits is approximately 15.  
This would be 3 hours of work Monday-Friday, or 2 hours of work daily.  
I aspire to work about 2-3 hours per day, and to respond to my work hours with fluidity rather than setting a concrete begin working - end working schedule.
If I spend more than 3 hours in one day working, I should take the next day off; if I work 15-17 hours in a week, I should take a weekend until the start of the next week.  
*Week 1 will be odd in total-hours, because the official week does not start until Thursday--making Week 2 the first full-length week.*
  
### Default Output for creating an RMarkdown .rmd file


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
