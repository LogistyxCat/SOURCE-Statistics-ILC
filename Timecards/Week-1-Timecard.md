### Working Plan

I am signed up for 6 credits with this ILC; the appropriate number of
hours per week spent working for 6 undergraduate credits is
approximately 15.  
This would be 3 hours of work Monday-Friday, or 2 hours of work daily.  
I aspire to work about 2-3 hours per day, and to respond to my work
hours with fluidity rather than setting a concrete begin working - end
working schedule. I am timing my work by using a stopwatch app on my
phone as I work and pausing said stopwatch if I take breaks. If I spend
more than 3 hours in one day working, I should take the next day off; if
I work 15-17 hours in a week, I should take a weekend until the start of
the next week.  
*Week 1 may be short in total-hours, because the official week does not
start until Thursday–making Week 2 the first full-length week.*
