**Friday** Aprx. 0 hours 30 minutes - ZOOM call, discussed supplementing
book with R sites since the book is kind of slow.

Overall, not a very good week; quarentine limiting my physical activity
has made maintaining my appetite difficult, so I’ve been getting sick a
lot due to forgetting to eat. I’ll be looking into incooperating more
non-stationary activitites into my day so that I actually get hungry.  
Incidentally, Week 1 was supposed to be a short week and week 2 was
supposed to be the first full week . . . but I did the other way around
instead. Assuming I’m doing better after this weekend for Week 3, I
should still be on-track.
