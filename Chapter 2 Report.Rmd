### Notable Vocabulary 
**IDE** - Integrated Development Environment  
**GUI** - Graphical User Interface  
**CSV** - Comma-seperated Values

### Notable Vocabulary from Introduction  
**R** - A programing language for statistical computing and analysis.  
**HLL** - High-level languages (like R) are programing languages made to 'make sense' to humans, but take more time for a computer to process.  
**LLL** - Low-level languages are computer-language based programing languages.  They are less intuitive to use, but faster to excecute.  
**Statistics** - A collection of mathematics that deals with the organization of, analysis of, and interpretation of data.  Descriptive, inferential, regressions analysis: types of statistics.  
**Data science** - Statistics+computer science+machine learning+buisness expertise  
**Data mining** - Identifying patterns from numeric information  
**Data text mining** - Identifying patterns from text-based information.  This requires techniques like text classification; text clustering; part-of-speech tagging; sentiment analysis.  
**NLP** - Natural language processing - data text mining requires this; machine learning that halps with recognizing human language text based patterns.  
**Big Data** - Data that's too big and complex for a computer to process on its own. Volume of data; speed of data coming in (velocity); variety of techniques required to analyze the data properly; make data big data.  
**Descriptive analytics** :: descriptive statistics  
**Predictive analytics** :: inferential statistics  
**Perscriptive analytics** :: using and applying inferential statistics 

### Figures to keep handy  
![](Images/Fig23report1.png)
This figure shows the placement of the R Code Editor (toedp left corner), Workspace Showing Variables (top right), R Console (bottom left), Plots and Others (bottom right).  It is on page 22 of *Title:Learn R for Applied Statistics* in the RStudio: The IRE for R section.  

### Commands Used: print(), data, summary(), plot()
The **print() function** is the first function introduced in Chapter 2.  I printed the text "Hello World", and also experimented with being able to print any other text by talking about my squeaky doorhinge.  Use of this function has not yet been explained in R, but if I remember correctly, when using Kali Linux the print() function (or whatever its equivilant is) is important so that you can select what was printed and further use it in command line. 
```{r print}
print("Hello World");
print("The doorhinge for our room is really squeaky and loud");
```
 
The book wanted me to use a data set called MyData to see **output of all the data; summary of the data; and a plot of the data** . . . I do not have a .csv file named myData in my directory, however I DO have cars data that comes automatically from creating an Rmarkdown type file so I used that data to experiment with listing all the data; giving a summary of the data; and plotting the data.  If I typed into the R Code Editor, I needed to highlight the command and use Run; if I typed it into the R Console, I simply need to press Enter on my keyboard.  The plot() command makes a plot appear in the Plots and Others section, wheras naming the dataset and using the summary() command makes the information appear in the R Console.
```{r cars}
cars
summary(cars)
plot(cars)
```

Chapter 2 also familiarized me with the **History tab** in Workspace; if I double click on something in the workspace, it will appear in the R Console, and then I can press Enter to run it.

I typed this report as an Rmd (R Markdown) file within the R Code Editor.
